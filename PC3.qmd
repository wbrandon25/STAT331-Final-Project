## Introduction

In this project, we will investigate the relationship between life expectancy at birth and GDP per capita across various countries. Life expectancy at birth represents the average number of years a newborn is expected to live, based on current mortality rates. This data is sourced from the United Nations Population Division through Gapminder [@gapminder_lex]. GDP per capita measures the economic output per person, adjusted for purchasing power parity in constant 2021 international dollars, and is also obtained from Gapminder [@gapminder_gdp]. 

The life expectancy dataset includes data for 196 countries spanning the years 1800 to 2100, while the GDP per capita dataset covers a similar range for 195 countries. We will be joining and merging the two dataset to explore the relationship between an country's life expectancy and their GDP per capita. The observations in the new dataset will correspond to a unique country-year pair, containing values for both variables alongside the country and year identifier.

## Hypothesis

We hypothesize a positive correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy, meaning that higher economic output per person is generally associated with longer life spans. We expect this relationship to be moderately strong, as countries with greater wealth typically have resources to invest in healthcare, nutrition, and infrastructure, all of which contribute to improved health outcomes.

This expectation aligns with findings from @miladinov2020, who studied five EU accession candidate countries (Macedonia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Albania) from 1990 to 2017. Using a Full Information Maximum Likelihood model, they found that higher GDP per capita and lower infant mortality rates significantly increase life expectancy at birth, suggesting that socioeconomic development is a prerequisite for longer life. While we anticipate a general trend where increases in GDP per capita correspond to higher life expectancy, exceptions may exist, such as countries with high GDP per capita but stable life expectancy due to already low mortality rates or other limiting factors.

## Data Cleaning

To prepare the data for analysis, we undertook several cleaning steps to ensure consistency and reliability. Below, we outline the process, address specific issues such as countries with empty columns or missing data, and discuss the decisions made along with their potential impacts on the analysis.

1. **Reshaping the Data**  
   Both datasets were originally in wide format, with countries as rows and years as columns. The life expectancy dataset includes 196 countries and 301 years (1800–2100), while the GDP per capita dataset covers 195 countries over the same period. We transformed each into long format, where each row represents a country-year pair with its respective value (life expectancy or GDP per capita). This restructuring facilitates merging and analysis across time.

2. **Handling Non-Numeric Values in GDP Data**  
   The GDP per capita dataset contained some values with a "k" suffix (e.g., "10k" for 10,000), indicating thousands. To standardize these, we read all columns as characters, removed the "k" suffix where present, multiplied those values by 1000, and converted the resulting column to numeric format. This ensures all economic output values are consistently represented as numbers.

3. **Joining the Datasets**  
   We performed an inner join on the "country" and "year" columns, retaining only country-year pairs present in both datasets. This includes years from 1800 to 2100 where data is available for both life expectancy and GDP per capita. Countries with data in one dataset but not the other (e.g., a country with GDP per capita data but no life expectancy data for the same years) are excluded from the combined dataset. Similarly, countries with completely empty columns in the original wide format, meaning no data for any year in one of the variables will have no corresponding rows after reshaping and joining, effectively excluding them from the analysis.

4. **Removing Missing Data**  
   After joining, we excluded rows with missing values in either life expectancy or GDP per capita. This ensures a complete dataset for analysis but reduces the sample size by omitting partial records, such as years where one variable is unavailable even if the other is present.

5. **Filtering Life Expectancy**  
   We will then appliy a filter to retain life expectancy values between 0 and 120 years, reflecting a realistic biological range. No current values exceeded this threshold, but this safeguard protects against potential future anomalies.

### Implications of Cleaning Decisions
- **Inner Join**: By retaining only country-year pairs with data in both datasets, we ensure completeness but exclude countries with data in only one dataset (e.g., GDP per capita but no life expectancy). This also handles countries with empty columns, as they will not contribute any rows to the combined dataset.
- **Missing Value Removal**: Enhances reliability by avoiding incomplete observations but may exclude additional country-year pairs, potentially biasing the sample toward countries with more consistent data reporting across both variables.
- **GDP Conversion**: Standardizing "k" values enables accurate statistical analysis, critical for exploring economic-health relationships.
- **Life Expectancy Filter**: Maintains data integrity by excluding implausible values, though it is currently not triggered.

The cleaned dataset was saved as `cleaned_combined_data.csv` for subsequent analysis. These steps prioritize data quality over inclusivity, potentially limiting the number of countries and years included—particularly for countries with sparse or non-overlapping data—a trade-off we will consider when interpreting results.

### R Code for Data Cleaning

Below is the R code used to clean and prepare the data. Each chunk is commented for clarity.

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(knitr)

# Read datasets, specifying all columns as character to handle mixed types
gdp_per_capita <- read_csv("gdp_pcap.csv", col_types = cols(.default = "c"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv("lex.csv", col_types = cols(.default = "c"))

# Reshape GDP per capita data to long format
gdp_per_capita_long <- gdp_per_capita |>
  pivot_longer(cols = -country, 
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "gdp_per_capita", 
               names_transform = list(year = as.integer))

# Reshape life expectancy data to long format
life_expectancy_long <- life_expectancy |>
  pivot_longer(cols = -country, 
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "life_expectancy", 
               names_transform = list(year = as.integer))

# Convert GDP per capita, handling "k" suffix
gdp_per_capita_long <- gdp_per_capita_long |>
  mutate(gdp_per_capita = ifelse(str_ends(gdp_per_capita, "k"),
                                 as.numeric(str_remove(gdp_per_capita, "k")) * 1000,
                                 as.numeric(gdp_per_capita)))

# Convert life expectancy to numeric
life_expectancy_long <- life_expectancy_long |>
  mutate(life_expectancy = as.numeric(life_expectancy))

# Join datasets using an inner join
combined_data <- inner_join(life_expectancy_long, gdp_per_capita_long, 
                            by = c("country", "year"))

# Remove rows with missing values
cleaned_data <- combined_data |>
  filter(!is.na(life_expectancy) & !is.na(gdp_per_capita))

# Filter life expectancy to realistic range (0–120 years)
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data |>
  filter(life_expectancy >= 0 & life_expectancy <= 120)

# Save the cleaned dataset
write_csv(cleaned_data, "cleaned_combined_data.csv")
```
